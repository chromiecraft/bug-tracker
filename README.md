## Bug reports

Users can report bugs using the ChromieCraft bug-tracker

- **Bug reports**: https://github.com/chromiecraft/chromiecraft/issues
- **Create new bug report**: https://github.com/chromiecraft/chromiecraft/issues/new

It is then duty of the AzerothCore contributors, or anyone in general that wants to contribute with the ChromieCraft project, to:

- Verify the issues reported by the users (check validity, duplicates, etc...). If they are valid, open a report on the AC main repo, add the [[1-19]](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/labels/1-19) label and link the original issue to it.

- Report directly to the AC repo any bugs that you find by yourself applying the same label.
