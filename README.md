## FOR CONTRIBUTORS: how to triage/report bugs

### Triage

It is duty of the [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) contributors, or anyone in general that wants to contribute with the ChromieCraft project, to:

1) Verify the issues reported by the users (check validity, duplicates, etc...). All issues awaiting to be triaged are marked as [[needs triage]](https://github.com/chromiecraft/chromiecraft/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22needs+triage%22).

2) If the issue is not valid (missing information, not a bug, etc...) it should be closed (or ask the user for clarification).

3) If the issue is valid and the bug can be reproduced on a clean AC server (at a recent version), it's needed to open a report on the [main AC repo](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/issues). You can literally copy-paste the issue from ChromieCraft to AzerothCore, as the template already contains all information needed for AC. In addition, add the link of the original issue reported on ChromieCraft ("Originally reported LINK-TO-CHROMIECRAFT-ISSUE"). This way GitHub will automatically link the two reports.

4) On the issues reported in the AC repo, it's needed to add the proper label, for example [[1-19]](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/labels/1-19).

5) On the issues reported on the ChromieCraft repo, mark them as LINKED adding the proper tag. Once the linked issue on AC has been closed, we can add FIX-READY to the ChromieCraft report.

6) Admins will close all FIX-READY marked issues as soon as ChromieCraft gets updated with the latest AC

### Report

If you find a bug yourself, you can report directly to the AC repo. You can copy paste [this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chromiecraft/chromiecraft/main/issue_template.md) and just fill the bug description.
